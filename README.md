# BLOG_APPLICATION


This is a Blog Web Application developed in Django Framework used HTML, CSS as Frontend Technologies.......

I have created the basic blog models, views, templates, and URLs to display blog posts, build QuerySets with the Django ORM, and configured the Django administration site, handle forms and model forms, send emails with Django, and integrate third-party applications. I have also implemented a comment system for the blog posts and allow users to share posts via email.
